<p>I finally figured out Creative Commons attribution — Wikimedia Commons puts the proper attribution in HTML form for you to copy-and-paste when you download an image. This one&rsquo;s the &ldquo;end of a world&rdquo; — feels epic. Somehow, I&rsquo;m in the mood for that kind of thing at the moment.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s already been a week since I came back from home for spring break, so it&rsquo;s true what they say about time flying — it happens all the time, and you can&rsquo;t do anything about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not complaining, being that I have some exciting things coming up in the next few months (I hope) — I&rsquo;m pretty certain that that research role I may have mentioned before (and which I&rsquo;ve been after for about a month now) is just about mine, but you know, I still think an internship in industry is probably better and worth keeping on trying to find. Oh, well — it&rsquo;s not like this is really a compromise for me, I really want to do research while I&rsquo;m still an undergraduate — I want to have a hand in this kind of thing but can&rsquo;t really see myself staying for grad school — so I&rsquo;m still looking forward to it.</p>
<p>About a week before then, I&rsquo;ll have that trip I&rsquo;m so excited about. Last week I discovered the <a href="https://waterparken.water.gov.taipei/cp.aspx?n=1C14F8279CF33E8F">drinking water museum</a> and I&rsquo;m certain that this is the first plan on the docket for day 1, before the actual program begins and I&rsquo;m actually busy. This is history, and it&rsquo;s water, and that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about ten weeks in, but I think that it&rsquo;s really now that my semester is settling down and getting steadily better — at least, as of right now — and what I mostly mean is that, yesterday, I discovered that one of the practice rooms below the student union has a mic &amp; speakers in the wall. I can now duet with myself as freely as I please. <a href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0fbEg1b4b985RyobzYicKDs5w#canzonetta">Like this</a></p>
<p>That, and I recently started using Yellowbridge flash cards &amp; I realize that this (flash cards in general, I know someone else who uses Anki but I couldn&rsquo;t find any decks that I liked) is probably most people&rsquo;s default learning resource for getting far — while I&rsquo;ve always felt like the Chinese classes I take at school move slowly, I think you&rsquo;re meant to find external resources for self-learning like this. I like Yellowbridge because the site is very nice-looking, there aren&rsquo;t any ads if you pay (there are if you don&rsquo;t, but it&rsquo;s still worth using) and most of the HSK flashcard sets are free (not the 6 and 7-9 ones, but if you&rsquo;re that good already, you might as well just become a paid subscriber because this is clearly part of your lifestyle).</p>
<p>Sold by the fact that Yellowbridge has an option to study HSK flashcards in traditional characters and that you can use the arrow keys to move through the flashcard viewer, I became a paid subscriber after using the decks for only a few days. It&rsquo;s $25 for six months. I&rsquo;d rather have flashcards than groceries, anyway. Besides, this <em>is</em> part of my lifestyle.</p>
<p>With all of these recent discoveries on my side, I&rsquo;ve been having a good week.</p>
<p>So far, this morning, I&rsquo;ve managed to wake up cold again, realize that the thermostat&rsquo;s been off since we had nice weather that one time on Wednesday and that the inside temperature has dropped to ten degrees below what that thermostat is set to (so I turned it back on), do some of those easy-points reading assignments for my circuits class, and this morning, I drove to Starbucks because I still have several dozen dollars in Starbucks credit given to me across Christmases and birthdays of past years &amp; now that I have a car, I can explore around town going to different Starbucks and getting coffee and food for free.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/today_tomorrow/college_town.jpg" alt="My view from today&rsquo;s Starbucks"></p>
<p>That store on the right side of the picture in my view out the window — Joy Mart — is excellent. My favorite store. They sell four or five different flavors of 大白兔. I might drop by on my way out the Starbucks to get some more of that. That&rsquo;s also where I got the cheese latte of thumbnail-image quality those few weeks ago, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably going to rain later today, but at least it&rsquo;s not snow and it&rsquo;s about fifty degrees (F) outside — this is my personal preferred kind of weather, although that&rsquo;s definitely because I&rsquo;ve just resigned to nostalgia over practicality as far as what I consider to be a &ldquo;nice day&rdquo; — this is what a springtime birthday in the northeastern US does to your soul.</p>
<p>Speaking of views of streets, one of my hobbies as of late&rsquo;s been going on to Google Street View and examining the area around the hotel we&rsquo;ll be staying at for the one-week program — and beyond (because I need to do more on my two days off than just go to a water museum).</p>
<p>Definitely out-of-the way, but an excuse for a first 高鐵 ride — it&rsquo;s a wonder how some places even manage to make street corners look cute.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/today_tomorrow/tongai_st.png" alt="Mopeds be zoomin&rsquo;."></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in the &ldquo;<em>Like Taipei, but more humid</em>&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;<em>Like Taipei, but with Cs instead of Qs</em>&rdquo; &hellip; land of fable. Regardless, visiting a place like Kaohsiung would be cool, despite people&rsquo;s reports of &ldquo;<em>It was nice, but there was nothing to do there so I just got back on the train and went back to Taipei</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The world is small, and distances are short, but time is shorter. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll be able to put these plans into action soon.</p>
<p>I should probably get out of the Starbucks before the rain starts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be back here (on the site and probably at the Starbucks, too) next week.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
