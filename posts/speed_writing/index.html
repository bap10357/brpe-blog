<p>This is what I&rsquo;m doing today — I&rsquo;ve got 20 minutes until my first class starts&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;but the blogging impulse came on &amp; I think the thumbnail image from my post this past weekend isn&rsquo;t super aesthetically-pleasing to have on the front page of my website. I want to make this page nice-looking and nice to read!</p>
<p>As far as plans from the recent past goes, I&rsquo;ve made progress</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginning the discussion about a summer research internship</li>
<li>Two emails further into the double major application process</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve got my housing decided &amp; it&rsquo;s with people that I know (with one spot free to be filled by a stranger — we still have yet to find out who)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also did some theming on my laptop &amp; I have it looking pretty nice — nice enough to be worth sharing. If you have a Mac and you&rsquo;ve never enabled the &ldquo;Silver Aerogel&rdquo; theme, it looks pretty cool.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/speed_writing/terminal.png" alt="Frosted glass terminal window. If this were a real terminal, it&rsquo;d have cataracts."></p>
<p>I steel feel a little bit of a strange combination of on top of my assignments &amp; a behind, because of the number of liberal arts classes I&rsquo;m taking this semester while simultaneously being an engineering major — I&rsquo;m just trying to get caught up and finish my gen-eds, but it&rsquo;s made for a strange schedule for the time being. Not to say I don&rsquo;t enjoy it — I have a rehearsal, sectionals, and a concert all back-to-back this afternoon. That&rsquo;ll be cool!</p>
<p>I still have an engineering-related class to go to in ten minutes, though — all my morning classes are the STEM ones, so in effect, I start every day with some electrical math things &amp; then it turns itself around pretty quickly. Next semester will either hit like a truck or be the most refreshing thing I&rsquo;ve ever felt — I can&rsquo;t wait to find out which.</p>
<p>Spring break is half a week closer, and with the weather still so nice I&rsquo;m really hoping to bring my bicycle back to campus from home (maybe even ride it around while I&rsquo;m at home). Spring is springing — usually it needs a little bit of help around this time of year and/or acts like my electric kettle has been as of late &amp; heating the water up a little, then letting it cool back down and then actually bringing it up to temperature (maybe I should buy a new kettle, each heating cycle is progressively longer than the last).</p>
<p>So, at the end of the day, things are going. The university career fair is exactly a week from today, which is exciting and stressful (as all exciting things are) — I&rsquo;d love to have an internship lined up for the fall right now (especially before I go home for a week to regenerate brain cells — I want to have one less thing keeping me up at night).</p>
<p>At the beginning of the day, though (now), I need to get to class, so I&rsquo;m going to end this here for now.</p>
<p>Hopefully you appreciate the better thumbnail photo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be back!</p>
