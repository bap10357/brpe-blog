<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve done my writing practice ‚Äî both of yesterday&rsquo;s posts ‚Äî¬†I can write the rest of my thoughts out for the weekend.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m attracted back to my blog a lot now that I&rsquo;ve updated the layout &amp; theme a little bit. I keep coming back here and it occurred to me that, not only am I a little bit bored in between studying for an exam that I have tomorrow, but that I also have a little bit more to add before I can feel like I&rsquo;ve really extracted all that I can from this place for the time being.</p>
<p>This week, I have a few things to look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An exam tomorrow morning (at least it&rsquo;s in the morning, so I&rsquo;ll have the rest of my day to try and forget about it). It&rsquo;s in IC Technology, so an important class, which means I can&rsquo;t make any stupid errors. We&rsquo;re allowed to bring a notes sheet, so that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A meeting to discuss adding an Applied Chinese double major (this is on Tuesday, so still fairly early in the week). I&rsquo;m not sure what exactly there will be to discuss in the meeting, but I&rsquo;ve already laid out my potential roadmap several times &amp; I think I have one that&rsquo;ll work. I just need to get the relevant people with authority on board to let me in to the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Housing selection times, which get emailed out on Thursday ‚Äî¬†I&rsquo;m trying to room with people I know already, unlike in my first year, but also somewhere on campus, unlike this past year. We just get to know our selection times this week, but I get to at least hope that our group&rsquo;s is acceptable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing I don&rsquo;t have to look forward to this week is the weather ‚Äî the picture above is from today. It&rsquo;s been a little warm lately and been snowing a lot. Since it&rsquo;s warm, the ground is warmer than the air and the snow&rsquo;s been melting on the walkways and turning to slush. The temperature drops by about 20 degrees tonight, so it&rsquo;s all going to turn to ice, and it seems like it&rsquo;s going to stay that way all week. I had better get in my penguin-walking practice to avoid severe spinal damage (or I&rsquo;ll just minimize the amount of outdoor walking that I have to do, which I usually go for during the winter anyway).</p>
<p>All of these things aside, I feel like the semester is heating up a little bit in a good way. I feel a lot more in control than I have in the past, although this is definitely because the classes I&rsquo;m taking now are relatively easy compared to prior semesters. I&rsquo;m just catching my schedule up, so hopefully, I can get into a reasonable balance of academics &amp; confidence again sometime soon. I&rsquo;m looking for a summer-fall internship, so this should be next spring ‚Äî the semester that I&rsquo;ve been preparing my schedule for all these past two years (at least, that&rsquo;s what it seems like now ‚Äî this is my last semester with required gen-eds).</p>
<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s going to have to heat up soon is, again, the weather. I thought Lunar New Year was supposed to be the beginning of spring, but I haven&rsquo;t seen any meaningful difference since the wood snake rolled onto the calendar. Last winter was really mild ‚Äî maybe the dragon breathes fire. I never hear the groundhog day news anymore, either, so the future remains unclear.</p>
<p>You know, people talk about the weather everywhere &amp; all the time. I think it gets old for some people. I only look forward to spring because it comes with the end of the semester (and I guess my birthday too). Just, a good season overall. Once it&rsquo;s over and the weather gets too hot, I&rsquo;ll start looking forward to next year&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Regardless of how stale the things that I care about are or how good my writing is when I&rsquo;m talking about them, I appreciate the read ‚Äî maybe I should just start traveling. I don&rsquo;t get on enough trains. I don&rsquo;t have any spring break plans yet, so anything is possible.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m empty for now. My writing queue is cleared.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be back next week.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize there was a fish emoticon, that&rsquo;s cool ‚Äî¬†just found out about this today and see no problem signing off with it.</p>
