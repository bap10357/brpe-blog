  "articleBody": "\nNow that I’ve done my writing practice — both of yesterday’s posts — I can write the rest of my thoughts out for the weekend.\nI’m attracted back to my blog a lot now that I’ve updated the layout \u0026 theme a little bit. I keep coming back here and it occurred to me that, not only am I a little bit bored in between studying for an exam that I have tomorrow, but that I also have a little bit more to add before I can feel like I’ve really extracted all that I can from this place for the time being.\nThis week, I have a few things to look forward to:\nAn exam tomorrow morning (at least it’s in the morning, so I’ll have the rest of my day to try and forget about it). It’s in IC Technology, so an important class, which means I can’t make any stupid errors. We’re allowed to bring a notes sheet, so that’s nice.\nA meeting to discuss adding an Applied Chinese double major (this is on Tuesday, so still fairly early in the week). I’m not sure what exactly there will be to discuss in the meeting, but I’ve already laid out my potential roadmap several times \u0026 I think I have one that’ll work. I just need to get the relevant people with authority on board to let me in to the program.\nHousing selection times, which get emailed out on Thursday — I’m trying to room with people I know already, unlike in my first year, but also somewhere on campus, unlike this past year. We just get to know our selection times this week, but I get to at least hope that our group’s is acceptable.\nOne thing I don’t have to look forward to this week is the weather — the picture above is from today. It’s been a little warm lately and been snowing a lot. Since it’s warm, the ground is warmer than the air and the snow’s been melting on the walkways and turning to slush. The temperature drops by about 20 degrees tonight, so it’s all going to turn to ice, and it seems like it’s going to stay that way all week. I had better get in my penguin-walking practice to avoid severe spinal damage (or I’ll just minimize the amount of outdoor walking that I have to do, which I usually go for during the winter anyway).\nAll of these things aside, I feel like the semester is heating up a little bit in a good way. I feel a lot more in control than I have in the past, although this is definitely because the classes I’m taking now are relatively easy compared to prior semesters. I’m just catching my schedule up, so hopefully, I can get into a reasonable balance of academics \u0026 confidence again sometime soon. I’m looking for a summer-fall internship, so this should be next spring — the semester that I’ve been preparing my schedule for all these past two years (at least, that’s what it seems like now — this is my last semester with required gen-eds).\nThe other thing that’s going to have to heat up soon is, again, the weather. I thought Lunar New Year was supposed to be the beginning of spring, but I haven’t seen any meaningful difference since the wood snake rolled onto the calendar. Last winter was really mild — maybe the dragon breathes fire. I never hear the groundhog day news anymore, either, so the future remains unclear.\nYou know, people talk about the weather everywhere \u0026 all the time. I think it gets old for some people. I only look forward to spring because it comes with the end of the semester (and I guess my birthday too). Just, a good season overall. Once it’s over and the weather gets too hot, I’ll start looking forward to next year’s.\nRegardless of how stale the things that I care about are or how good my writing is when I’m talking about them, I appreciate the read — maybe I should just start traveling. I don’t get on enough trains. I don’t have any spring break plans yet, so anything is possible.\nI think I’m empty for now. My writing queue is cleared.\nI’ll be back next week.\n𓆝 𓆟 𓆞 𓆝 𓆟\nI didn’t realize there was a fish emoticon, that’s cool — just found out about this today and see no problem signing off with it.\n拜拜🙏 ！\n",

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve done my writing practice — both of yesterday&rsquo;s posts — I can write the rest of my thoughts out for the weekend.</p>
