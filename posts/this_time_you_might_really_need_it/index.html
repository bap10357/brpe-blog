<p>I know this is a time for a lot of people in the US that keep up with any amount of political news. I walked around today, and all day, nobody said anything. That’s probably a good thing. I shouldn’t care so much about government, but you know, I have to live in a place with a single figurehead all the way in the front, so I guess it’s natural to care who that person is.</p>
<p>Whether you’re happy or disappointed, it’s always a good time to add another track to your (existent or not) orchestral/wind ensemble music library, and this time, it’s even a little different! I bought a Switch a while ago, and since I had Switch Online, I got a notification about it when that new “Nintendo Music” app came around. Being someone born in the mid-2000s who has the obligatory fondness for Nintendo games and their music, I thought I’d try it out. Plus, the Kirby Star Allies soundtrack is on there, and that’s already a killer app for me (not that I’ve ever played anything more than just the demo for the actual game).</p>
<p>Anyway, my uninformed, but still interested, musical mind stumbled across the fact that Pikmin music’s instrumentation is usually all orchestra (I just haven’t played too many Pikmin games, I guess). Pikmin 4’s definitely going the “relaxing &amp; cute” way of many Nintendo games in the past few years, and it’s entirely welcome. In the list of top tracks from Pikmin 4 — a game that listening to the soundtrack to might lead me to eventually buy despite never having considered myself a Pikmin fan — was the closing-credits theme, which is just 漂亮得不得了!</p>
<p>You see, I’m getting this week’s grammar practice in, too.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s just incredible. And, it’s in a really slow 3/4, but it isn’t super “waltz-ish”. I don’t know much about music theory, but I think that the effect is cool.</p>
<p>If you need music to sit out, stare into the sunset, and eat baby carrots to while watching a colony of ants lift a breadcrumb down a wall to some tiny anthill in the grass, this is it.</p>

<p>I hope “Nintendo Music” doesn’t get these YouTube channels taken down, because this is truly a public service.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
