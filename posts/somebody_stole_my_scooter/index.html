<p>*I finally made use of that AI integration with wordpress.com — my scooter didn’t look like the one in the picture, but it was the same color, and the company that manufactured it did in fact use those letters in their name (not in that order, but 差不多一樣).</p>
<p>Actually, this happened about a week ago, but I think I’ve fully accepted that I’m never going to get it back now, so I might as well just complain about it on the Internet.</p>
<p>Op-sec just isn’t my forte, I guess. Whatever. It’s fine. I can walk.</p>
<p>If you happen to see a white NIU KQi 2 Pro with the front logo scratched off and missing (I took a pretty hard fall on it a couple of times in one trip… I had a little bit of a cold and definitely shouldn’t have been riding a scooter…), you know that it has a nonzero probability of being formerly mine.</p>
<p>I did detach it from my NIU account (which I also deleted, since I don’t have another NIU scooter), so whoever has it can actually use it. I couldn’t remotely lock it even if I wanted to, because all its wireless connectivity is over Bluetooth.</p>
<p>I see it this way: if they accidentally lock it by holding the power button for too long (since that’ll auto e-lock the scooter and keep the wheels from turning until you unlock it again using Bluetooth), then they had it coming. If they don’t, then they stole themselves a free scooter. No hard feelings here. At the end of the day, I was the one who spent the money and then didn’t tie the lock tight enough.</p>
<p>If you reading are the one that took it — have fun. Return it if you feel bad. I’ll forgive you.</p>
<p>To you all — have a nice day.</p>
