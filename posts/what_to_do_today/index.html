    <p><img src="/posts/what_to_do_today/ipod_shuffle.jpg" alt="My green iPod."></p>
<p>I like organizing and cleaning, and my mom seems to be on board with me doing that here now that I&rsquo;m home. So, maybe, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do.</p>
<p>About the photo — when I came home, I had a package waiting for me — last December, I bought an iPod Shuffle 2 on eBay and I left for school the day before it arrived. Now I have it in my hands! I did have one of these when they were new, but I was in preschool and my parents bought it for me because I was the annoying kid who wouldn&rsquo;t sleep during nap time. They bought me a cheap iPod so that the music would keep me quiet. That one was blue, but I think the green one looks nicer now.</p>
<p>Aside from that, it&rsquo;s always hard to get used to the distinctly different places to be that are school and home — I mean, for one, I can&rsquo;t get around here at all without a car. There are roads everywhere. I can&rsquo;t take a walk to the store because that would take several hours.</p>
<p>I could drive downtown, though, and take a walk around. The weather&rsquo;s nice today — it&rsquo;s going to get to a high temperature of something well above freezing, which means that spring is truly springing now. For the first meeting with my study-abroad group partners, I gave a little presentation on myself, the city where I go to school and the city where I&rsquo;m from. As part of showing these places off, I had to remember the cool things to do that actually do exist around town.</p>
<p>Downtown, once I got there and parked my car, would have a cool little coffee shop, a nice square, a candy store, multiple places to get lunch, some places that are probably photogenic (although I stole one of my mom&rsquo;s old cameras a while ago &amp; loaded it with an SD card intending to make it my primary limited photo-taking device for the forseeable future. I forgot it at my apartment at school).</p>
<p>Whatever I do, I&rsquo;d like to be really relaxing. I&rsquo;ve been a little tired lately, but I haven&rsquo;t necessarily realized it with all the momentum of the mid-semester. I can&rsquo;t stop rambling about nonsense in most of my sentences, though, which in the past would&rsquo;ve been a dead giveaway that I need sleep. The placebo from the daylight-savings clock shift was a good head start — I should try to continue the cycle of 睡得香 as long as I&rsquo;m here at home for the week. The bed at home is infinitely more comfortable than the larger one at my apartment.</p>
<p>I could get my bicycle out and try to ride it around — although the only real destinations that I&rsquo;d have would be downtown/near where the people are and, seeing as it&rsquo;s a Monday and there&rsquo;s traffic around, I don&rsquo;t think my mom would approve of it while I&rsquo;m around her.</p>
<p>I recently got myself a Legere european-cut synthetic reed for the clarinet &amp; it&rsquo;s pretty fantastic. No preparation, no soaking, no adjusting (I don&rsquo;t even have an adjustment tool, I had to borrow one from a friend the last time I used one). I started practicing with it a few times yesterday and the dog doesn&rsquo;t enjoy my noises (or, he really enjoys them and he&rsquo;s trying to sing along).</p>
<p>I could bike to the middle of the woods and practice out there&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;but then I&rsquo;d just annoy the bears.</p>
<p>哎呀。</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll just clean the kitchen.</p>
<p>And keep writing blog posts.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll be back next week!</p>
<p>See you then.</p>
