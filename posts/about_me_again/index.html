<p>I’ve been blogging for a while! I think this is the longest-lived single Internet presence in my history. I’m proud of that. I think I’m learning to actually build on my own work over time, instead of throwing it around and deleting things whenever I’m bored.</p>
<p>I was looking through my first post — “about me” — and I realized that I should probably give something more up-to-date that works in the same place.</p>
<p>I’m here to assert myself on the Internet!</p>
<p>Or, more accurately, I like poking around the Internet and reading about other people and other things and thought it’d be fun if other people poking around the Internet could do the same to me in return. You can’t take without giving back, right?</p>
<p>I have a lot of fun noodling on a clarinet in the orchestra while trying to know what I&rsquo;m doing despite having no formal training (&hellip;to be corrected soon), I never miss a chance to offer support to my favorite writing systems, 繁體中文 and its unforgettable companion, ㄅㄆㄇㄈ, and I’m hoping to one day be comfortable around a semiconductor fab, but as it stands, I’m trying to achieve mastery of the venerable undergraduate-style lab report.</p>
<p>Everybody’s got to have their own skills, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes, my attempts at humor are weak, sometimes not, and sometimes, I just come here to gush and treat my site like it’s therapy, which works surprisingly well. Whether what gets turned out is really that good a product or not, writing out some thoughts usually feels nice.</p>
<p>My writing is a little inefficient out of a lab setting, though, so my posts, this one included, should all be short or very short. I make the conscious choice to treat my blog like a much safer, much more sheltered and sane version of Twitter.</p>
<p>I’m waiting for Web 2.1 to come rolling out like a Windows XP service pack in 2009, become the next big excitement, and to see all those X users come over to the blogging side once more… or, at least, I can hope.</p>
<p>My user icon (visible on the guestbook page) is from Windows 7, and the lighting and colors on the lucky cat it gives that kind of funky minimal-cross-Frutiger-Aero Myst-style appearance that has a neat feel. I also just like the shade of green in the background.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me reintroduce myself! This is the canonical “about-me” copy now.</p>
<p>I’ll be back soon!</p>
