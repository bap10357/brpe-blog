<p>It&rsquo;s my second blog post for the day. I had to re-date this morning&rsquo;s as being from yesterday to get Hugo to put them chronologically in the feed, so I apologize for the bad record-keeping.</p>
<p>I think I should feel jet-lagged, but the six hour flight from Boston barely felt like anything. The day still feels normal.</p>
<p>But it could be worse, and in fact, it soon will. In about three hours, our plane is going to start boarding &amp; I&rsquo;m going to be strapped to a chair on a fancy winged bus for fourteen hours, which I&rsquo;m sure won&rsquo;t be the greatest experience of my coming week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finally in Seattle, now, though, which means that I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve never been out west before — although aside from the view of the tram that I caught leaving by on some tracks parallel to the international departures terminal and a higher proportion of evergreens to other deciduous flora, it looks pretty much the same as the east.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what gate my flight is leaving from, since the flights to Taipei weren&rsquo;t shown on the departures board &amp; the ticket doesn&rsquo;t have that information (just says to look at the departures board). I&rsquo;ll be able to learn soon enough, because I think the board&rsquo;s going to update &amp; worst-case scenario, the international departures gate here isn&rsquo;t very large and I could just scan it over with my feet and eyes. It seems right now like I&rsquo;m at the right gate, but at the moment it&rsquo;s got a flight leaving to Seoul (a really cool place that I&rsquo;ve love to go, I hear, but I don&rsquo;t know any Korean and I didn&rsquo;t buy that ticket. Someday).</p>
<p>I got some neat pictures while I was in the sky flying across the US — these are over North Dakota, Washington, and some random part of Seattle — the last one isn&rsquo;t particularly beautiful as much as it looks strikingly like SimCity 3000.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/contact_at_sea_tac/nd.png" alt="Boxes on the ground."></p>
<p>This one is the one that people talk about when they mention that 1-square-mile land plots rule that came around sometime about two centuries ago, but that us in New England never quite caught on to.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/contact_at_sea_tac/mountains.png" alt="Big mountains."></p>
<p>I never realized what people were talking about when they discuss the vast expanse of the Rocky Mountains. If they&rsquo;re epic enough to be as clearly visible from an airplane as they were for me, I guess they live up to the hype. And they&rsquo;re beautiful to boot.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/contact_at_sea_tac/seattle.png" alt="Does life imitate art?"></p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the proper part of Seattle, but seems like quintessential suburban America. Much better-looking from the top-down than from ground level, I think. I&rsquo;d like to find the part of Seattle with all the good public transit and the Space Needle. Someday, I&rsquo;ll come back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have another post like this tomorrow when I land for the final time, but I&rsquo;ll be busy on the airport (I&rsquo;ve never been on an international flight before and have no clue what this entails), so I&rsquo;ll wait until I get to my hotel room to write that up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m as excited as ever. Just highly caffeinated and impatient as I stare at the gate looking to see if this is the right one. I&rsquo;m probably going to make an exercise trip back to the departures board after I&rsquo;m done here anyway.</p>
<p>The world is neat. This is a new experience for me.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking in again, multiple times a day. It keeps me occupied!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be writing more again soon.</p>
