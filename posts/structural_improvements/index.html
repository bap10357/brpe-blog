    <p><img src="/posts/structural_improvements/infinity.png" alt="My quest for good urban environments."></p>
<p>The week is already going by nicely, but not too quickly. At least, I enjoy my new job way more than I&rsquo;ve ever enjoyed my old ones.</p>
<p>The picture in the thumbnail is the first of (likely many) attempts to try to find good urban environments in the vicinity to make me feel less insane — I&rsquo;ve already spent more than $100 on gas money in the past week (that&rsquo;s, like, three tank refills), but the isolation of the metal box I need to get anywhere around the city is depression fuel in itself.</p>
<p>Luckily, I have Mt. Hope, Park Ave., and the campus here. Although, all are too far from each other for me to walk between them. Mt. Hope even has 樂生活 Joy Mart, a neat little store where they sell melon bread and 「經典港式奶茶」, which I hadn&rsquo;t known was a thing at all until this week, but now I drink it every morning. It is like $1.00 per bag, though.</p>
<p>Because I have to start work soon, this is a quick post, but I also wanted to mention the other things that are good for sanity — first, walking to work in the morning (which I can do because both home and work are on campus), sleeping well, eating well (more restaurants are open around here than I had anticipated), and having interesting material to read — especially the last one.</p>
<p>I heard about the book <em>Orphan of Asia</em> by 吳濁流 Wu Zhuoliu (pretty sure I got the characters right?) — for a story about a 20th-century small-town citizen of the Japanese Empire, the main character is surprisingly relatable (I think some things just transcend cultures). I&rsquo;ll try to refrain from spoilers, but the story has its ups and downs. It&rsquo;s sort of expensive on Kindle (you can get a paperback copy for cheaper, actually). I will also probably do that soon (after my first paycheck).</p>
<p>I also cleaned out my photo library this morning. The more I get nice art representing the places around me, the more I appreciate them — that might be a little bit of a life hack. I recently opened an account on Wikimedia Commons to showcase (and make public and public-domain) some of my best photos — you can get the link at <a href="https://brpe.neocities.org">my new links page</a>.</p>
<p>Actually, this new page seems to be a good way to lend my Web presence a friendly URL without my having to pay for a domain (just look at the URL bar above this blog!). Regardless, I think everything here is easy enough to navigate for now. I apologize for the straight week of inconsistency, things will go back to stable now.</p>
<p>This shot is not too far from Rochester:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/structural_improvements/ontario.png" alt="Lake Ontario beachfront."></p>
<p>This is nice nature, but I seem to be (at least lately) more into finding places with the right amount of compromise between interest and beauty. More cityscapes will follow.</p>
<p>As the lights in the room next to me start to turn on, I realize I should probably get off the blogging and start being <del>productive</del> an intern.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be back soon!</p>
