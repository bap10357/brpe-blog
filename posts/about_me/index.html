<p>It happened again — I was just playing with fire and wiping my computer as I do when I’m bored (actually, this time, I had a good excuse — I just bought a 2015 MacBook Pro at a flea market and was setting it up so I could use it — I used to have a Framework Laptop, but I sold it because I would rather have had the money. The new MacBook was only $180, and it’s pretty great!). Anyway, I inadvertently wiped the source files for my old blog. I forgot to back this one up, so it’s more-or-less gone. I mean, I have the public HTML files, but I can’t add any new content and I was thinking of starting anew anyway.</p>
<p>So here I am! WordPress is a little nicer for the end-user than Hugo. I mean, I know Hugo (the static blog/site compiler that I was using before this) makes it easy to develop fast sites and create your own themes and layouts, but as far as having customization options with as little hassle as possible (considering that I’m not a software developer, although I am a proud now-second-year EE student), WordPress is definitely my preferred choice.</p>
<p>If I have to write it in words, I’ll say that the mission statement for this blog is for me to share my interests and to be able to summarize myself at any point in time with one convenient, easily-accessible stop. Besides, blogging is fun and expressive.</p>
<p>Those interests are a little varied, but they include EE (of course)-related topics (like EE projects and even sometimes actual computer things), learning Mandarin (although I’m definitely at a fairly low level — I started learning when I was in about seventh grade, but then I took a two-year break at the end of high school, because they ended their own Mandarin education program, then restarted once I got to college last year). 我想用我的博客練習中文語法，也告訴你們我現在學什麼。你也能看，我喜歡用繁體字。比簡體字更漂亮，也是台灣用的，現在好像我不要去中國……</p>
<p>Today, I’ve been struggling with trying to determine whether the sore throat, congestion, chills and minor muscle aches that I have are a cold or severe allergies. I have to work tomorrow, and I still don’t have an internship yet, so I can’t really afford to be missing days. I’ll take some allergy medicine tonight and work it out in my sleep?</p>
<p>One more thing — on my last blog, I put up a “wallpaper of the day” to go with each blog post. I think I can get more creative than that, though — what you see above is the “photo in my library of the day” (which is mostly an encouragement for me to make better use of my phone’s camera, which is, in all honesty, not terrible — it’s a Unihertz Jelly 2). 不錯，對不對？</p>
<p>Thank you for taking a look!</p>
