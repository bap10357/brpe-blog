<p>For one more Saturday, I&rsquo;m sitting at the same Starbucks again looking out the same window. I came in this morning and despite not having been here for two weeks, it seems like at least one barista recognized me. How <em>not opsec</em> of me? I guess I have a memorable face.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s usually kind of cloudy and cold on Saturdays in Rochester during the spring, today it&rsquo;s less cold and just raining.</p>
<p>My finals are done and I&rsquo;m even mostly almost done my part of our group&rsquo;s business project, so after I made some edits to our slide deck today I think I&rsquo;ll be able to fully enjoy the &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; coming up. Expect lots more blog posting soon.</p>
<p>After I finish my finals every semester, I&rsquo;m usually not reminded of how boring life without school really is because I have a least a day of travel back home, a day or two with my parents, and then the reality sets in. Since this semester, I&rsquo;m staying on-campus for a few days before attending a conference and <em>then</em> going home, the boredom had its chance to realize itself as soon as I turned in my last final.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I took my old PC out of the closet and set it up with a Goodwill monitor and some cables (expensive ones, apparently — supply chain issues are the theme of the decade? It was over $30 for a DVI-HDMI cable, a USB-C cable, and an Ethernet cord!).</p>
<p><img src="/posts/state_of_things/desk.jpg" alt="The rig."></p>
<p>I had donated the graphics card that had been in it — an RX 580 8GB, which is honestly still pretty great — to a friend a while ago who was trying to build a PC. The Goodwill monitor served to temper my gaming performance expectations accordingly (I can&rsquo;t be disappointed that a game isn&rsquo;t running at 120 FPS and 1080p when my monitor is 1024 by 768 at 60 Hz).</p>
<p>After using RHEL with MATE in the integrated circuit design lab for a class this semester, my number one desktop operating system of choice (when I get to choose) is now Fedora with Mate/Compiz, so I installed that, Prism Launcher, and Steam, and I had some fun with that this morning. It runs Tetris Effect pretty well (my one real requirement).</p>
<p>The CPU is an AMD Athlon 200GE, so the integrated graphics aren&rsquo;t excellent, but also not horrible. The power consumption is (I&rsquo;d assume, anyway) pretty low (I have a couple of Kill-a-Watts, so if I wanted to, I could test that. I might do that later).</p>
<p>This has really been my entertainment for the past two days or so (really, a day and a half).</p>
<p>As far as grades go, I&rsquo;m at least still hopeful. The class that I felt the worst about was my circuits class, which I had a rolling grade of &ldquo;B-&rdquo; in before I went in to the final.</p>
<p>After I left the test, though (which I had plenty of time to study for, so on the final, I felt much better than on most past circuits exams), I learned about a &ldquo;grade replacement&rdquo; policy — the professor will replace the lowest exam grade with your final grade if the final grade was better.</p>
<p>After a little bit of trial-and-error calculation, it seems like that means that if I got a 95 percent or better on the final, my circuits grade will jump from a B- to an A-, which would be excellent. I&rsquo;m still holding out hope.</p>
<p>In other news related to &ldquo;holding out hope&rdquo;, I still haven&rsquo;t heard back about my interview yet. Actually, the conference I&rsquo;m going to next week is on the same campus as my interview was, and it&rsquo;d be really funny if I run into the recruiter while I&rsquo;m there (especially since I learned lately that we&rsquo;re going to go on a facility tour for the exact company I interviewed with and already got a facility tour of during the interview).</p>
<p>There really isn&rsquo;t anything I want more in my life right now than this job. I&rsquo;ve said that to most people I know by now. I think that my most valuable trait is the patience that I&rsquo;m going to convince myself I have so that I can use it — waiting is hard, though.</p>
<p>Before the job, I think things have the potential to go pretty well in the next few weeks. I will at least <em>have things to do</em>! If I can survive the boredom of today, tomorrow, and most of Monday, I&rsquo;ll have the trip to the conference on Monday night, the conference itself from Tuesday through Thursday, I&rsquo;m driving home Thursday night, I have Friday to (probably) do things at home (maybe), then I&rsquo;m visiting a friend on Saturday afternoon (Saturday is also Mother&rsquo;s Day, so I told my mom I wanted to spend the morning with her, which is always a good plan).</p>
<p>Sunday is too far out for me to declare a boredom epidemic just yet, and besides, when I&rsquo;m at home I can&rsquo;t bother the neighbors when I try to practice Arabesques by Paul Jeanjean on my clarinet in my bedroom, so of course I&rsquo;ll have things to do (it even deters those annoying dogs).</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m just joking about the last thing. But when I talk about the things I do with my life, it makes me sound like such a basic sheep that the embarrassment hits the signed-integer size limit and turns into pride).</p>
<p>The following Thursday is the day that the travel begins, and Friday is the day that my 台灣旅遊 really starts. Again, 要貼博客很多. Maybe I&rsquo;ll even bring that old camera I stole from my mom and finally put it to use.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be lots of flash cards to flip and listening practice to do before then, though, because I need to be on my A-game for the entire 9 days of real travel. The next time following this that I&rsquo;ll try to be back is spring of 2027, which seems far into the future. I need to extract as much value as possible from the limited time I have!</p>
<p>謝謝光臨！</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be back reporting from 家裡 next week. See you then.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>After this post had been up for a few hours, I still didn&rsquo;t have much to do, so I set my PC up a little closer to an accessible outlet and started up Tetris Effect with a Kill-a-Watt at the end of the power cable.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/state_of_things/tetris.jpg" alt="It looks cleaner now, anyway."></p>
<p>The outlets in my apartment are upside-down, so apologies for the strange-looking shadows.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/state_of_things/watts.jpg" alt="Surprisingly low power draw!"></p>
<p>The reading is less than 50 W. Neat!</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing that kills my time around now. 再見！</p>
