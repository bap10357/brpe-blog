<p>I don&rsquo;t have a picture in mind to put at the top of the post, so whatever is there is something I found after I was done writing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be pretty busy over the weekend, and I felt like blogging anyway right now, so even though it&rsquo;s Friday (right at the end of the week), I&rsquo;m going to say that my weekend mood-recovery begins now &amp; I&rsquo;m feeling like blogging some words out right in this moment.</p>
<p>This has been the last full week of classes, so next week I have my last group of Monday lectures, reading day, and then all my finals. At least I know that in about a week it&rsquo;ll all be over and I can sleep properly.</p>
<p>Right before this, I got into the writing mood by way of a lab assignment that I had thought was due Monday. I somehow corrupted the PDF with the requirements on it, so I went online to download another copy and noticed that the due date got pushed back from April 27 to May 4. There&rsquo;s no feeling of productivity quite like working on something slowly, but watching the due date get pushed back way further than is necessary to compensate.</p>
<p>This means that I just have a presentation to give with my group in the Taiwan-business class today, and we might have our business plan practice document to rework (last week I did the whole thing by myself, and I even did it about the wrong company&hellip;). The professor said it was fine anyway because it was just practice for the business plan we should be writing with our group partners, but now I&rsquo;m confusing myself.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have that to worry about and this lab report.</p>
<p>After the business class ends at 12 today, the first one won&rsquo;t be a concern anymore. I have the rest of the day to finish after that and pretty much only the lab report to think about long-term — in the same class as the lab report, we have a take-home exam due over the weekend, but it&rsquo;s two questions long and I might just do it on Sunday afternoon. Regardless, I should be feeling good about my progress in all the classes by the end of Monday.</p>
<p>I tend to get overwhelmed by finals week. I think that&rsquo;s the point, though. I just want to get it all done. This is all that&rsquo;s on my mind, I guess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll still have assignments to do after finals week, but only for the business class, since it doesn&rsquo;t end until the end of May (because of the traveling part). I have a meeting with my group partners this Sunday morning, so if we&rsquo;re efficient we can potentially just get the whole project ground out at once. I&rsquo;m hopeful. We only technically need to produce two deliverable documents (the business plan and the pitch slide deck). After that, the whole of the business plan is just <em>thinking out the details</em>, which I consider myself good at.</p>
<p>We do have an orchestra performance tomorrow, though, and those videos should be good (in all hope). I&rsquo;ve now — somewhat unfortunately — been promoted to &ldquo;acting first part&rdquo; clarinet for this half of the semester and couldn&rsquo;t have possibly been less mentally prepared: I thought I didn&rsquo;t have stage fright that badly, but now I keep shaking during solo sections (even though they&rsquo;re not that large in the pieces we&rsquo;re doing now). I&rsquo;ll just need to turn the brain off for a while and play the things and feel the emotions while I&rsquo;m up there. I have friends in the orchestra (right now) that I don&rsquo;t intend to lose&hellip;</p>
<p>Outside of school, I still haven&rsquo;t heard back about my job interview last Wednesday. I&rsquo;m a little worried — they said it&rsquo;d be a &ldquo;week or two&rdquo;, so we&rsquo;re still not near the end of the time frame, but I can&rsquo;t not get concerned — but today <em>is</em> my birthday, so if they send the email sometime later on then that&rsquo;d be really fantastic. I would never have gotten a better birthday gift in my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently sitting in a place of about 70 percent pessimism and 30 percent hope about my career prospects over the summer.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, though, it&rsquo;ll at least probably be interesting and a decent learning experience. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I have a backup plan, still, as far as just staying here and working over the summer, and I&rsquo;d have time to find a job for the fall in that case, but that&rsquo;s a lot less certain of a prospect than having it sorted out now at my dream employer, so I don&rsquo;t want to make too much out of those possibilities.</p>
<p>So, basically, right now, I&rsquo;m unemployed but still overwhelmed by work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just waiting for the things &ldquo;to get good&rdquo;.</p>
<p>聽到好消息我就回來。</p>
<p>那後見！</p>
