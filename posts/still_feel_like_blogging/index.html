  "articleBody": "\nI don’t have a picture in mind to put at the top of the post, so whatever is there is something I found after I was done writing.\nI’m going to be pretty busy over the weekend, and I felt like blogging anyway right now, so even though it’s Friday (right at the end of the week), I’m going to say that my weekend mood-recovery begins now \u0026 I’m feeling like blogging some words out right in this moment.\nThis has been the last full week of classes, so next week I have my last group of Monday lectures, reading day, and then all my finals. At least I know that in about a week it’ll all be over and I can sleep properly.\nRight before this, I got into the writing mood by way of a lab assignment that I had thought was due Monday. I somehow corrupted the PDF with the requirements on it, so I went online to download another copy and noticed that the due date got pushed back from April 27 to May 4. There’s no feeling of productivity quite like working on something slowly, but watching the due date get pushed back way further than is necessary to compensate.\nThis means that I just have a presentation to give with my group in the Taiwan-business class today, and we might have our business plan practice document to rework (last week I did the whole thing by myself, and I even did it about the wrong company…). The professor said it was fine anyway because it was just practice for the business plan we should be writing with our group partners, but now I’m confusing myself.\nAnyway, I have that to worry about and this lab report.\nAfter the business class ends at 12 today, the first one won’t be a concern anymore. I have the rest of the day to finish after that and pretty much only the lab report to think about long-term — in the same class as the lab report, we have a take-home exam due over the weekend, but it’s two questions long and I might just do it on Sunday afternoon. Regardless, I should be feeling good about my progress in all the classes by the end of Monday.\nI tend to get overwhelmed by finals week. I think that’s the point, though. I just want to get it all done. This is all that’s on my mind, I guess.\nI’ll still have assignments to do after finals week, but only for the business class, since it doesn’t end until the end of May (because of the traveling part). I have a meeting with my group partners this Sunday morning, so if we’re efficient we can potentially just get the whole project ground out at once. I’m hopeful. We only technically need to produce two deliverable documents (the business plan and the pitch slide deck). After that, the whole of the business plan is just thinking out the details, which I consider myself good at.\nWe do have an orchestra performance tomorrow, though, and those videos should be good (in all hope). I’ve now — somewhat unfortunately — been promoted to “acting first part” clarinet for this half of the semester and couldn’t have possibly been less mentally prepared: I thought I didn’t have stage fright that badly, but now I keep shaking during solo sections (even though they’re not that large in the pieces we’re doing now). I’ll just need to turn the brain off for a while and play the things and feel the emotions while I’m up there. I have friends in the orchestra (right now) that I don’t intend to lose…\nOutside of school, I still haven’t heard back about my job interview last Wednesday. I’m a little worried — they said it’d be a “week or two”, so we’re still not near the end of the time frame, but I can’t not get concerned — but today is my birthday, so if they send the email sometime later on then that’d be really fantastic. I would never have gotten a better birthday gift in my life.\nI’m currently sitting in a place of about 70 percent pessimism and 30 percent hope about my career prospects over the summer.\nNo matter what happens, though, it’ll at least probably be interesting and a decent learning experience. I’m pretty sure I have a backup plan, still, as far as just staying here and working over the summer, and I’d have time to find a job for the fall in that case, but that’s a lot less certain of a prospect than having it sorted out now at my dream employer, so I don’t want to make too much out of those possibilities.\nSo, basically, right now, I’m unemployed but still overwhelmed by work.\nI’m just waiting for the things “to get good”.\n聽到好消息我就回來。\n那後見！\n",

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a picture in mind to put at the top of the post, so whatever is there is something I found after I was done writing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be pretty busy over the weekend, and I felt like blogging anyway right now, so even though it&rsquo;s Friday (right at the end of the week), I&rsquo;m going to say that my weekend mood-recovery begins now &amp; I&rsquo;m feeling like blogging some words out right in this moment.</p>
