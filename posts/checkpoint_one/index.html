<p>For leg number one of the long journey, I&rsquo;m sitting in the wrong terminal at the airport in Boston waiting for a flight to come that doesn&rsquo;t leave for another two hours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at the wrong gate because the gate I&rsquo;m supposed to be at has a different flight boarding in about half an hour, but it seems to be packed, and there isn&rsquo;t much space over there. The gate I&rsquo;m at is a different flight (to Los Angeles), but it seemed a little emptier. I&rsquo;m within easy viewing distance of the right place, though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;m going to do for the next two hours, but that&rsquo;s standard airport fare. I&rsquo;ll just listen to podcasts now so that I can start reading on the first flight.</p>
<p>One exciting note from the past few days is that I managed an interview at another company I&rsquo;d really like to intern at — ASML — but it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;asynchronous, virtual&rdquo; interview and I have to record myself answering three questions and then write a response to six more. I&rsquo;m going to spend some of the plane time getting my thoughts down — I&rsquo;ve already done two practice questions from the video portion — and once I&rsquo;m in the hotel, I&rsquo;ll use the single room-time that I have (even if it isn&rsquo;t much) to try to record the video portion.</p>
<p>Apart from planning for the near future — the upcoming very long two days/day and a half/day (it really depends how you think about it) — I have the upcoming one-week program, the flight back, and then a few months of being a research assistant. I&rsquo;d like to squeeze as much knowledge and experience out of these nine or ten days as I can, because it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll have to keep with myself all summer.</p>
<p>I only took a backpack through airport security. That&rsquo;s all I have right now — it has my clothes, toiletries, phone, Kindle, and laptop, which is reasonable. It&rsquo;s a large backpack. I might want to buy a suitcase at some point, but that&rsquo;s a problem for later the way I see it — I didn&rsquo;t have a problem getting into the gate with just the backpack, and it took about ten minutes from walking into the airport to getting through security, so I&rsquo;m hoping to keep it that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only blogging now because of all the extra time I built in to my schedule today — it was potentially a bad idea, although I felt good about myself when the usual I-93 exit to the airport was blocked by construction work that there wasn&rsquo;t any kind of notification of online (it must be new, I guess?). Changing highways to I-90 and getting off there was fine, though. Someday, I&rsquo;ll just be able to take a train or a bus from home to Boston (you can take a bus now, but I&rsquo;m still waiting on the Boston-DC high-speed rail, so any train dreams in and around Boston seem feasible to add to the plan. I&rsquo;d like to propose the extension that cuts through Portland, Maine and Concord, New Hampshire — everybody seems to forget about the cooler places!).</p>
<p>My writing feels a little less-than-coherent to myself at the moment. Just saying hello to my two-person readership, both of who I know are from Boston and probably asleep at the time of writing. Thanks for the inspiration, this is a shout-out.</p>
<p>And for my mom, who I think looks around here on occasion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be back in about eight hours, equally bored and ready to judge the facilities at Sea-Tac, my first view of the timeless American West.</p>
<p>有趣吧。</p>
<p>再見！</p>
