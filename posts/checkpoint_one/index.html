<p>For leg number one of the long journey, I&rsquo;m sitting in the wrong terminal at the airport in Boston waiting for a flight to come that doesn&rsquo;t leave for another two hours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at the wrong gate because the gate I&rsquo;m supposed to be at has a different flight boarding in about half an hour, but it seems to be packed, and there isn&rsquo;t much space over there. The gate I&rsquo;m at is a different flight (to Los Angeles), but it seemed a little emptier. I&rsquo;m within easy viewing distance of the right place, though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;m going to do for the next two hours, but that&rsquo;s standard airport fare. I&rsquo;ll just listen to podcasts now so that I can start reading on the first flight.</p>
<p>One exciting note from the past few days is that I managed an interview at another company I&rsquo;d really like to intern at — ASML — but it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;asynchronous, virtual&rdquo; interview and I have to record myself answering three questions and then write a response to six more.
