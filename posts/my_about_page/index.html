    <p><img src="/posts/my_about_page/overview.png" alt="An overview of this city (and of me)."></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s come to my attention that the things that I had written on my last about page weren&rsquo;t quite what I wanted to have there anymore. So, here I am, writing another one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny to me that I just put the &ldquo;about&rdquo; pages as regular posts and then link them on the &ldquo;about&rdquo; tab, but I guess it makes sense because I use these as regular status updates, and that&rsquo;s really what a blog is for anyway.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I did another one of my 中文博客貼, which might be a little broken or not grammatically-correct, but that&rsquo;s up for all the native speakers out there to judge (please give me feedback if you have any! I know I&rsquo;m a super-beginner).</p>
<p>I know that this site is a little bit hard to search, so you might have to go by date if you want to see a post from any length of time ago.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time for my elevator pitch:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a second year microelectronics/electronics engineering student who is also double-majoring in Mandarin, which I honestly get way more into most of the time, but after all, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s in the degree, too.</p>
<p>I also play the clarinet, but I have most of my fun with that during the school year — now that the long summer term has started, I&rsquo;m going to have to get my musical motivation back after some time. I probably should, though, because it is fun.</p>
<p>I know that I have a few friends who read my blog, and I think maybe some of my family members read it sometimes, too. The friends are who I feel like I&rsquo;m writing to when I start putting a post down, though.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard a quote that I thought was pretty great and definitely applicable in a lot of cases (for myself and for people I know): that the &ldquo;reasonable person adapts to the world, but the unreasonable person adapts the world to themselves&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all of the enabling that I need in order to go ahead and be as unreasonable as I want. I mean, I know I&rsquo;m not the only one who&rsquo;s gripes with society take up too much of my headspace. At the time of writing, I went to Taipei last week and I saw a society that has Mandarin, traditional characters, no 兒化, a super-clean subway, beautiful streets, stupid cute ads everywhere, really great food, and prices that are equally excellent. I really feel like everywhere across the world should be taking notes. Can we all have something like that?</p>
<p>I have another sort of a side-hobby, which is photography with my phone camera. In order to temper my expectations of quality and to give myself some challenge to breed creativity, I try to use only relatively bad cameras (mainly my phone camera, which is an iPhone SE 3, which honestly is pretty excellent and not much of a limiter). I post these photos on my blog frequently, and I also have a (somewhat secret and new) photo gallery page where this blog used to be, at <a href="https://brpe.neocities.org/">this link</a>.</p>
<p>I also have my mom&rsquo;s old Canon handheld camera, which is fine but it&rsquo;s a little <em>too questionable</em> for even my taste. Although, someday I&rsquo;m still planning on buying an old Sony Mavica or something along those lines and having fun with it.</p>
<p>So, anyway, if you&rsquo;re looking to learn more about me, here&rsquo;s a checklist of the things I think are cool:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scallion pancakes and spicy falafel pockets</li>
<li>bo po mo fo ㄅ ㄆ ㄇ ㄈ</li>
<li>Dense and interesting cities</li>
<li>Trains (below ground, above ground, slow, fast, medium speed)</li>
<li>Landmarks that nobody else cares about</li>
<li>3:15 pm 3點1刻 brand coffee milk tea</li>
<li>Matcha flavored 大白兔 White Rabbit</li>
<li>Humble, unassuming desk setups</li>
</ol>
<p>I appreciate the look into my blog. I really hope you enjoy. And if you&rsquo;re already a reader (like one of my two friends), I hope you appreciate the general life-status update.</p>
<p>Have yourself a day!</p>
