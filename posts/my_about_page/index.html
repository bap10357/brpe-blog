<p>It&rsquo;s come to my attention that the things that I had written on my last about page weren&rsquo;t quite what I wanted to have there anymore. So, here I am, writing another one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny to me that I just put the &ldquo;about&rdquo; pages as regular posts and then link them on the &ldquo;about&rdquo; tab, but I guess it makes sense because I use these as regular status updates, and that&rsquo;s really what a blog is for anyway.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I did another one of my 中文博客貼, which might be a little broken or not grammatically-correct, but that&rsquo;s up for all the native speakers out there to judge (please give me feedback if you have any! I know I&rsquo;m a super-beginner).</p>
<p>I know that this site is a little bit hard to search, so you might have to go by date if you want to see a post from any length of time ago.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time for my elevator pitch:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a second year microelectronics/electronics engineering student who is also double-majoring in Mandarin, which I honestly get way more into most of the time, but after all, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s in the degree, too.</p>
<p>I also play the clarinet, but I have most of my fun with that during the school year — now that the long summer term has started, I&rsquo;m going to have to get my musical motivation back after some time. I probably should, though, because it is fun.</p>

<p>Recently, I heard a quote that I thought was pretty great and definitely applicable in a lot of cases (for myself and for people I know): that the &ldquo;reasonable person adapts to the world, but the unreasonable person adapts the world to themselves&rdquo;.</p>
