<p>I took a lot of photos over the past week and a lot of them have been making good wallpapers on my devices since then.</p>
<p>(Maybe not the thumbnail one, though. That one&rsquo;s just cute).</p>
<p>In order to share the love with others a little bit, I wanted to post some of those pictures here like a wallpaper collection.</p>
<p>It really is a &ldquo;beautiful island&rdquo;. Some of these are repeats from past posts — this is just a compilation.</p>
<p><img alt="Downtown Chiayi." loading="lazy" src="/posts/beautiful_island/downtown.png"></p>
<p>This is downtown Chiayi, a totally underrated city and a decent crossroads between urban environment with landmarks and country town without too many other tourists (at least, not American ones).</p>
<p><img alt="Xinyi District." loading="lazy" src="/posts/beautiful_island/highway.png"></p>

<p>中正紀念堂！This is one of those works where you <em>really</em> need to separate the art from the meaning.</p>
<p><img alt="Jiufen." loading="lazy" src="/posts/beautiful_island/jiufen.png"></p>
<p>Jiufen is a neat town with a cool old street, and it&rsquo;s got some nice mountain views. Actually, it seems like most of 新北 New Taipei City looks like this.</p>
<p><img alt="Ketagelan Boulevard." loading="lazy" src="/posts/beautiful_island/ketagelan.png"></p>
<p>Usually, Taiwanese street names are pretty predictable. One that seems fairly common is 介壽 Jieshou, &ldquo;long, sturdy life&rdquo; and a play on Chiang Kai-shek&rsquo;s name in Mandarin (蔣介石 Jiang Jie-shi). I think today&rsquo;s 凱達格蘭 Kai-da-ge-lan Boulevard (named for local indigines) is Taipei&rsquo;s former Jieshou Boulevard.

<p><img alt="Alishan railway." loading="lazy" src="/posts/beautiful_island/railway.png"></p>
<p>The Alishan railway is pretty much the most famous tourist attraction around Chiayi, to my knowledge (other than the many turkey rice establishments).</p>
<p><img alt="A collage-art wall." loading="lazy" src="/posts/beautiful_island/wall.png"></p>
<p>This was inside of an office building for a company we shadowed. Again, very colorful! Looks cool.</p>
<p><img alt="Taipei from the Maokong Gondola." loading="lazy" src="/posts/beautiful_island/wenshan.png"></p>
<p>This is a view of lower Taipei from the 貓空 Maokong gondola in Wenshan (technically part of the MRT, apparently). On an Apple laptop, the sun rays line right up with the notch, which is pretty classy (I have a Macbook Air).</p>
<p><img alt="The big giant egg." loading="lazy" src="/posts/beautiful_island/dajudan.png"></p>
<p>This is from a conference room in the same office building for the company we shadowed. This is in Xinyi District (the part of Taipei that looks like America in a lot of places).
