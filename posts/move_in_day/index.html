<p>Today’s been the first day that I’ve been fully moved in to my apartment, and although I was unsure how my experience would be before I got here, since I’ve arrived it’s been pretty nice. I’m pretty happy with my living situation here, I guess, although I won’t recommend it for fear of doxxing myself (the ever-present danger of talking about your life on the Internet).</p>
<p>Overall, it looks nice. I did put some effort into that — the furniture was provided, but of course none of the bedding/printer/amenities came with the room, so it was able to be personalized. The shower curtain didn’t come with the shower, either, and upon forgetting to buy rings to hang the curtain that I bought at Target, I accepted the engineering challenge.</p>

<p>So far, all I’ve managed to do is get myself in, get set up, and explore a little bit on that electric scooter that I bought in June, which is finally very useful (!).</p>
<p>As I was typing this, I also managed to open up this absentee ballot that I got in the mail — I can now vote in the primary for the political party that I guess I’m affiliated with now, and so I have my first foot in the door toward the timeless privilege of participating in democracy. Nice.</p>
<p>I just need to sit still until classes start at the beginning of the week. That’s when this all really gets good.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading the short post!</p>
