This has nothing to do with anything, and everything to do with my off-hours Mandarin studying strategies. I was looking around the internet last night and I found a neat tool, which also has an offline version. It’s a Chinese-English dictionary—I used to use the Yabla one until it went down earlier this week—this one has a little bit of additional information, too, like HSK levels. I’m not sure how the vocabulary from one to the other compares, but this one also has an offline version; on Mac, this is a dictionary that you can add to the “Dictionary” application, which makes it pretty clean and elegant and match with the rest of the user interface.">

<p>This has nothing to do with anything, and everything to do with my off-hours Mandarin studying strategies. I was looking around the internet last night and I found a neat tool, which also has an offline version. It’s a Chinese-English dictionary—I used to use the Yabla one until it went down earlier this week—this one has a little bit of additional information, too, like HSK levels. I’m not sure how the vocabulary from one to the other compares, but this one also has an offline version; on Mac, this is a dictionary that you can add to the “Dictionary” application, which makes it pretty clean and elegant and match with the rest of the user interface.</p>
<p>這是我找到的中文詞典：</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary"><img src="https://www.mdbg.net/logos/mdbg_hanyingcidian_trad_200x50.png" alt="MDBG Chinese-English dictionary" title="MDBG Chinese-English dictionary" style="border: solid 1px #c0c0c0" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>我希望你們喜歡，我已經能看這個詞典很好用。</p>
<p>If this is useful to you, I recommend you check it out! The full version is $15.95, which isn’t terrible, even if it’s just a dictionary. A paper dictionary would probably cost more than that, and this one is nice to keep around.</p>
<p>It can even do personal names of a few famous people (just see the thumbnail photo).</p>
<p>再見！</p>
